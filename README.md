### Description
This project is intended to provide an application for taking notes. Its set up is intended to be simple, so that notes can easily be taken on the go. Whether you are a business or an individual, things come up frequently during the day that you need to remember, but are soon easily forgotten. Enter note taker. The main challenge I faced with this project was getting the delete method to work. I was unable to figure it out in time.

### Installation

### Credits
My tutor, Corey Yates, guided me through the building of this project.

### Features
The note taker app can add and save mulitple notes. Once a note is saved, it's title appears in a list on the lefthand side of the screen. When you click on a note on the lefthand side, its content appears on the right. To create a new note, simply hit the plus sign and type a title and content in the two fields on the right. If you want to delete a note, you simple click on the trash can icon next to each note on the left that you want to delete.

### Future Development
In the future I plan on getting the delete method to work.
